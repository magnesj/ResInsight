ResInsight can create contour maps based on different forms of aggregation of 3D Eclipse data onto a 2D Plane. Any 3D result value can be aggregated, in addition to specialised results, such as Oil, Gas and Hydrocarbon columns.

## Creating New Contour Maps

Contour Maps can be created in many different ways:

- New Contour Map from the context menu of case or the **Contour Maps** project tree item underneath the case. These will create contour maps with default values.
- New Contour Map from 3d View in the Eclipse View context menu. This will create a contour map based on the existing 3d View with matching filters and result.
- Duplicate Contour Map from the context menu of an existing Contour Map. This will copy the existing map.
