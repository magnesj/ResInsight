ResInsight can display well logs curves directly in the 3d view with a subset of the functionality of the full [2D Well Log Plot Editor]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/welllogsandplots). The curves will be drawn in a plane next to or centered on the well trajectory they belong to and can display well log data from a simulation model alond a well trajectory and from imported LAS-files.
