ResInsight 2019.04 is the latest version of ResInsight, the professional quality, open source 3D visualization, curve plotting and post-processing tool for Eclipse reservoir models. Version 2019.04 contains a larger number of new and exciting features, some of which are listed below.

## Grid Cross Plots

ResInsight supports the creation of cross plots of two results against each other, with each cell in the grid representing one data point in the plot. The data points can be grouped by a third result, by time step or by Formations, giving a separate color and label for each group.

See [Grid Cross Plots]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/gridcrossplots)

## Saturation Pressure Plots

ResInsight can create contour maps based on different forms of aggregation of 3D Eclipse data onto a 2D map.

See [Contour Maps]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/contourmaps)

## Sector Model Export

Sub-sections of the Eclipse Grid with Parameters and Faults can be exported to Eclipse ASCII files in order to create new Simulations on the sub-section.

See [Export Sector Model]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/exportsectormodel)

## Well model for ICD and AICD
