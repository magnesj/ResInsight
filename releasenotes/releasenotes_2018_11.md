## Local Grid Refinement (LGR)
Local Grid Refinement (LGR) can be created based on Eclipse simulations. The refined grids can also be visualised in 3D.

See [Completions LGR]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/completionslgr)

## Well Path Creation
ResInsight lets the user create new/custom well paths by clicking in the 3D view. A self-established well path will behave in the same way as a regular imported well path.

See [Create Well Paths]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/createwellpaths)

## Contour Maps
ResInsight can create contour maps based on different forms of aggregation of 3D Eclipse data onto a 2D map.

## Summary Plotting

## Well Bore Stability Plots and Casing Design
ResInsight can create **Well Bore Stability** plots for Geomechanical cases. These plots are specialized **Well Log Plots** and contain a visualization of Formations, Well Path Attributes as well as a set of well path derived curves in two different tracks.

See [Well Bore Stability Plots]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/wellborestabilityplots)

## Memory Management
ResInsight can require a considerable amount of memory to hold all the grids and necessary result variables. A Memory Management system is now in place to help the user if available memory is low.
